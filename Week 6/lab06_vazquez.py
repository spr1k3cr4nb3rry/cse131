# Name: Izzie Vazquez
# Assignment Name: Lab 06: Sudoku Program
# Assignment Description: 
#   -  Extend the program from Lab 05 so it both plays the game of Sudoku and enforces the rules. To receive full credit, it must do the following:
#       1) Invalid input:Recognize if the user types something other than a coordinate or the letter 'Q' to quit
#       2) Reversed coordinates: Handle both "B2" and "2B" in the same way
#       3) Lowercase coordinates: Handle both "B2" and "b2" in the same way
#       4) Invalid number: Warn the user if an invalid number such as 0 or 11 is entered into the board
#       5) Square already filled: Warn the user if the selected square already has a number
#       6) Unique Row: Recognize if the user's number is already present on the selected row
#       7) Unique Column: Recognize if the user's number is already present on the selected column
#       8) Unique Inside Square: Recognize if the user's number is already present on the selected inside square
# Reflection:
#   - The hardest part of this for me was creating test cases, actually! I wasn't too sure which ones I should write down in my PDF, and which ones I should present in my video, so it took me a minute to finish my PDF!
# Time taken:
#   - Approximately 3 hours.
